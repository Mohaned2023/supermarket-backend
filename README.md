# About the project:
This project aims to consolidate Nestjs information in my mind \
and is also a practical exercise for most of the concepts in the \
backend world. I know that this project is only a very small part \
of the backend world, but it is a strong start as well.

This project is a simple project to simulate a small part of a \
supermarket system.

#### Features:
- Authentication and Authorization by JWT tokens.
- Roles Protection.
- Create Reports.
- Password Hashing.
- Swagger Documentation.
- Strong Validation.\
For more information run:
```bash
$ npm run doc
```

For those who read this simple project:\
I hope that I have benefited you in some way and I hope that I have \
conveyed to you my modest programming ability through this simple project.
